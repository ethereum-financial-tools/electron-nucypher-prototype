# Electron as GUI for NuCypher Applications (Updated)

## Summary

This is an Electron application which facilitates the secure sharing of files in an organization.

The mechanism enabling the sharing and revocation of sharing uses [pyUmbral](https://github.com/nucypher/pyUmbral) by NuCypher.

This prototype is based on work and forked from [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fyears/electron-python-example).

## Electron and Python3

This prototype currently depends on python3.6.

Installation of python3.6 and pyUmbral dependencies will be added here soon.
