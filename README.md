# Electron as a GUI for NuCypher Apps

## Summary

This is an Electron application which facilitates the secure sharing of files in an organization.


## Origin

This prototype is based on work by ["Fleeting Years"](https://www.fyears.org/about.html) and forked from [https://github.com/fyears/electron-python-example](https://github.com/fyears/electron-python-example). 

The README from this original project has been copied to [docs/electron-python-example.md](https://github.com/ethereum-financial-tools/electron-nucypher-prototype/blob/master/docs/electron-python-example.md).


## NuCypher pyUmbral and Python3

The mechanism enabling the sharing and revocation of sharing uses [pyUmbral](https://github.com/nucypher/pyUmbral) by NuCypher.

This prototype currently depends on python3.6.

Installation of python3.6 and pyUmbral dependencies will be added here soon.


## Swarm and Erebos

This prototype requires [Swarm v0.3.10](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/theswarm.eth/) and makes use of the [Erebos javascript library](https://github.com/MainframeHQ/erebos).


## Warning

Do not use this software for anything of value. It is a prototype.
